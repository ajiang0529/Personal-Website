                        Hello, my name is Andy Jiang. I am a sophomore at the University of Maryland majoring in Computer Science with <br> 
                        interests in software development and cybersecurity. Other than just being a student, I am a finance manager, <br>
                        hospital volunteer, and trilingual speaker. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When I am not in classes or working on projects, you can find me reinventing new recipes in a kitchen, <br>
                        exploring cities, or chasing a new personal record in the gym.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Project with implemenation of Java and Java Swing. Designed a game where the user clicks/clears clusters of the same color squares while <br>
                        they fall down. Inheritance was used to link the Game.java class and ClearCellGame.java class, and the design revolved around the <br>
                        use of 2D arrays filled with Boardcell enums. Java Swing was utilized to create a gui for the game: falling block animation, different <br>
                        colored blocks, generation of clusters, prevention of alternating colored block layers, score, game over message, and pop-ups that prompt <br>
                        the user to input number of rows, columns, and fall rate.
                    </p>
                    <h3 id="cproject1">User Interface</h3>
                    <p>Implemented with C and input/output redirection. Essentially a Microsoft Word mimic. User can input a command to modify a text file such <br>
                        as adding paragraphs, loading a file, deletion, highlighting, printing documents, etc. 
                    </p>
                    <h3 id="cproject2">Powershell</h3>
                    <p>
                        Implemented with C, boolean operations, pipes, and file redirection. Essentially a Windows Powershell mimic. This shell can process linux <br>
                        commands like cat, ls, cd, a.out, exit, tmp, etc. This powershell could also handle compound commands linked with &&(and) and |(pipes). <br>
                        The design revolved around a binary search tree structure with specific algorithms which traverse the tree a specific way based on and's and pipes.
